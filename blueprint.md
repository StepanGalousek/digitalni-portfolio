# Blueprint: Portfolio Website

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website for Štěpán Galousek, a student of Information Studies and Librarianship. The site showcases his bio, motivations, and a timeline of his academic journey.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the project.
*   `main.js`: The JavaScript file for the project.

## Design and Features

###- **Color Palette**
*   Background: `#ffffff`
*   Text: `#222222`
*   Accent: `#800020` (Maroon)
*   Header Background: `#111111`
*   Header Text: `#ffffff`

### - **Typography**
*   Headings: 'Playfair Display', serif
*   Body: 'Roboto', sans-serif

### - **Layout**
*   A full-screen header with a bio.
*   A vertical timeline to showcase academic semesters and courses.
*   A modal window to display detailed information about each course.

### - **Features**
*   **Timeline:** An interactive timeline displays courses taken in different semesters.
*   **Modal:** Clicking on a course card opens a modal with more details.
*   **Scroll Animations:** Elements animate into view as the user scrolls down the page.

## Current Plan

I have refactored the project by separating the CSS and JavaScript into their own files, `style.css` and `main.js`, and updated the `index.html` file to link to them. This improves the project's organization and maintainability.
